# Multi-Source Transfer Learning
This is an exploratory analysis of the novel algorithmic and theoretically principled methods for a multi-source domain adaptation task. Most real-world datasets suffer from the problem of covariate shift where the distribution of input data changes across different domains thereby making it difficult to transfer learning from one environment to another. We hypothesize that using data from multiple source domains, causal inference techniques enable domain generalization. The central hypothesis is tested using current state-of-the-art causal inference techniques.
